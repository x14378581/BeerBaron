-Create a database table that is appended to each user. (One for requests, one for denials)

-Interaction:

 (REQUEST GENERATION)

 *Query database for username and stock information. Pull it into a table and print on front end of user dashboard.
 Next to it, create buttons that perform the buy/sell function. 

 When one of the buttons is triggered, push request data to database.

 (RESPONSE)

 *Write a listener that runs upon account load, and re-checks every 2 min for a database entry
http://php.net/manual/en/class.eventlistener.php

 *If found, then create a pop-up that prompts user to accept or deny request.

 *If request is denied, send something to the database stating this.

 *If request is approved, then do the appropriate math. 

*More Granularly*

- Listener on main (ajax function)
- Listener triggers every two minutes
- Call to checker.php (ajax function call)
- checker.php queries database for details. if exists... =>
- Pop-up (using js) with two buttons (accept or deny). Info is pulled into popup
- If accept, then call function accept(), else, call deny() 
- accept() performs maths to deduct cost of beer* and adds it to current user's stock, and then sends a message to database table.
- deny() simply sends message to database table, to be picked up by listener, later.


-After final transaction query is performed, run two queries...
  a) Query that populates the "response table" with an accept or deny repsonse for user requesting the transaction
  b) Delete original transaction from transaction table.
